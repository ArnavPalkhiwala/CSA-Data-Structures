## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort moves through a list of elements, checking whether an element is larger than the next, if so swap the two. This will cause large elements to bubble to the back, and small elements slowly move to the front. Eventually, after this process is done enough time the list will be sorted.

### Statistics:

```
Average Bubble Sort Time: 173.4375ms
Average Bubble Sort Comparisons: 1.24975E7
Average Bubble Sort Swaps: 6236010.6875
```

Big-O Complexity: O(N^2)

### Code:
```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> Tuple<Integer, Integer> bubbleSort(ArrayList<T> list) {
    int comparisons = 0;
    int swaps = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < list.size() - 1 - i; j++) {
            if (list.get(j).compareTo(list.get(j + 1)) > 0) {
                T temp = list.get(j);
                list.set(j, list.get(j + 1));
                list.set(j + 1, temp);

                swaps++;
            }
            comparisons++;
        }
    }

    return new Tuple<>(comparisons, swaps);
}
```

## Selection Sort:

Selection sort splits a list into a subarray which is sorted, and another which is not. It begins with the entire array being unsorted, and moves the smallest element to the front. Now the first element belongs to the subarray which is sorted, and we remove it from the unsorted subarray and repeat. Once we've moved through the whole array the list will be sorted.

### Statistics:

```
Average Selection Sort Time: 45.3125ms
Average Selection Sort Comparisons: 1.24975E7
Average Selection Sort Swaps: 4999.0
```

Big-O Complexity: O(N^2)

### Code:
```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> Tuple<Integer, Integer> selectionSort(ArrayList<T> list) {
    int comparisons = 0;
    int swaps = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
        int min = i;

        for (int j = i + 1; j < list.size(); j++) {
            if (list.get(j).compareTo(list.get(min)) < 0) {
                min = j;
            }
            comparisons++;
        }

        T temp = list.get(i);
        list.set(i, list.get(min));
        list.set(min, temp);
        swaps++;
    }

    return new Tuple<>(comparisons, swaps);
}
```

## Insertion Sort:

Insertion sort takes an element, and compares it with every element before it until it finds the position at which it is smaller than the next element but larger than the previous element and inserts it there. This is done for every element in the list, and at the end the list will be sorted.

### Statistics:

```
Average Insertion Sort Time: 48.9375ms
Average Insertion Sort Comparisons: 6247429.1875
Average Insertion Sort Swaps: 6252428.1875
```

Big-O Complexity: O(N^2)

### Code:
```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> Tuple<Integer, Integer> insertionSort(ArrayList<T> list) {
    int comparisons = 0;
    int swaps = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) {
        T temp = list.get(i);
        int j = i;
        while (j > 0 && temp.compareTo(list.get(j - 1)) < 0) {
            list.set(j, list.get(j - 1));
            j--;
            comparisons++;
            swaps++;
        }
        list.set(j, temp);
        swaps++;
    }

    return new Tuple<>(comparisons, swaps);
}
```

## Merge Sort:

Merge sort takes a divide and conquer strategy, splitting a list into half repeatedly until a list has been split into the smallest pieces possible. Then we proceed to recursively merge these subarrays into an order array, by using a two pointer method where we compare the top of two subarrays and add which ever element is smaller, and increment that subarray. At the end of the recursive tree, we now have a merged sorted list.

### Statistics:

```
Average Merge Sort Time: 50.5625ms
Average Merge Sort Comparisons: 5000.0
Average Merge Sort Swaps: 5000.0
```

Big-O Complexity: O(N log(N))

### Code:
```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> Tuple<Integer, Integer> mergeSort(ArrayList<T> list) {
    int comparisons = 0;
    int swaps = 0;

    if (list.size() > 1) {
        ArrayList<T> left = new ArrayList<T>();
        ArrayList<T> right = new ArrayList<T>();

        for (int i = 0; i < list.size() / 2; i++) {
            left.add(list.get(i));
        }
        for (int i = list.size() / 2; i < list.size(); i++) {
            right.add(list.get(i));
        }

        mergeSort(left);
        mergeSort(right);

        Tuple<Integer, Integer> stats = merge(left, right, list);
        comparisons += stats.x;
        swaps += stats.y;
    }

    return new Tuple<>(comparisons, swaps);
}

private static <T extends Comparable<T>> Tuple<Integer, Integer> merge(ArrayList<T> left, ArrayList<T> right, ArrayList<T> list) {
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
    int comparisons = 0;
    int swaps = 0;

    while (i < left.size() && j < right.size()) {
        if (left.get(i).compareTo(right.get(j)) < 0) {
            list.set(k, left.get(i));
            i++;

            swaps++;
        } else {
            list.set(k, right.get(j));
            j++;

            swaps++;
        }

        comparisons++;
        k++;
    }

    while (i < left.size()) {
        list.set(k, left.get(i));
        i++; k++;

        comparisons++;
        swaps++;
    }
    while (j < right.size()) {
        list.set(k, right.get(j));
        j++; k++;

        comparisons++;
        swaps++;
    }

    return new Tuple<>(comparisons, swaps);
}
```

## Conclusion: 

After examining all 4 methods of sorting, **Merge Sort** is the best because it has the smallest Big-O Time Complexity, a 3-way tie in terms of average time, and the smallest amount of swaps and comparisons.
