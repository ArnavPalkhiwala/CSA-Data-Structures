# Topic: Data Structures

#### Intro

- A data structure is a method of organizing data.
- Think of algorithms as dynamic underlying pieces that interact with data structures. Together, data structures and algorithms combine and allow programmers to build whatever computer programs theyâ€™d like.


#### Programming Paradigms

- Imperative Paradigm
    - A programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.
    - Consists of a list of commands that describe how the program operates.
- Object Oriented Paradigm
    - A programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
    - Used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints


#### Basic Data Structures:

- Arrays
    - Linear data structure in which data is stored one after another. Iteration.
- Hash Maps
    - Non-Linear data structure in which data is associated with a key when stored.
